ðŸŒ² Binary Search Tree Validator
- A C# console application that checks whether a given binary tree satisfies the properties of a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Designed to help understand and validate BST logic through recursive traversal and value comparison.

ðŸ”§ Features:
- Validates binary tree structure using in-order traversal
- Supports both recursive and iterative checking methods
- Simple input format for quick testing
- Useful for learning data structures and algorithms in C#
